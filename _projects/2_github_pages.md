### Project page: [Create, build, and deploy GitHub Pages](https://gh-pages-project.github.io/pages/gh_pages_project.html)

### Abstract

Documenting our work is very important. If we do not document our work, with the passage of time we will forget the steps and process that helped us achieve our goal. Also, documentation helps showcase your work, collaborate with others, and makes it easier for others to build upon our dreams after we leave. It also helps improve our writing. [GitHub pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages) is an easy to use for this purpose. 

GitHub pages is a static website deployed on GitHub, free of charge, thanks to GitHub. The pages are used for documentation (for everything related to open source projects on GitHub) and GitHub user profiles.  In this project, we are going to learn how to create and deploy multi-repo GitHub pages under a GitHub organization, with comments functionality enabled using [giscus](https://giscus.app/). We will also learn how to setup [GitHub actions and workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for building and deployming the pages.
