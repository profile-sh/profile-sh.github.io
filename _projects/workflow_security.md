### Abstract

In CI/CD cycles, GitHub actions and workflows may need access to resources and services on GitHub or outside GitHub. Also, 
the outside services may need access to our resources on GitHub. It is very important to understand how to securely stitch 
together services and resources (public or private) in the CI/CD workflows.
