### Abstract

Software development involves several steps (installation, development, build, and deploy) that are repeated forever. GitHub workflows are a way to automate the software development cycle. In this project, we will create and use several workflows, reusable-workflows, and composite-actions to understand the GitHub workflow syntax. Visit [GitHub workflows and actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) for further help. 

Private repositories and organizations are beyond the scope of this document. We discuss basic contexts used in workflows and actions. Visit [context](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/accessing-contextual-information-about-workflow-runs#about-contexts) and [default variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/choosing-what-your-workflow-does/store-information-in-variables#default-environment-variables) docs for a complete reference.
